## Introduction

This research proposes a machine learning approach to accurately distinguish genuine breakouts from false signals (fakeouts) in financial markets, focusing on gold (XAU/USD) trading. By combining historical price data, trading volume, and macroeconomic factors through multi-modal data fusion, the model aims to improve breakout classification and enhance trading decisions. Using data from platforms like MetaTrader 5 and Binance API, along with economic reports, the system employs deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or Transformer) to capture complex market patterns influenced by both technical and external economic factors. This approach seeks to help traders identify high-probability trading opportunities, reduce risks, and optimize profitability amid volatile market conditions.

## Problem Statement

Accurate prediction of tradable moments, entry prices, and exit points remains a significant challenge in financial markets, particularly in volatile assets like gold (XAU/USD). Traditional forecasting models, which mainly rely on historical price data and technical indicators, fail to capture the complex interplay between market behavior and external macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, employment rates, and interest rate fluctuations. These models over-rely on historical data while neglecting the critical influence of macroeconomic indicators, leading to inaccurate predictions and missed opportunities. Additionally, they fail to account for the interdependencies between market trends and external economic conditions, resulting in fragmented insights. Existing approaches often analyze time series data in isolation, and the lack of an integrated, multi-modal framework that combines historical price patterns with macroeconomic contexts further limits the precision and adaptability of predictive tools.

## Proposed Solution

Introduces a multi-modal machine learning framework to improve financial forecasting by integrating historical price data, trading volume, and macroeconomic factors. Using deep learning, the model analyzes price trends and volume to gauge trend strength, while incorporating economic indicators like inflation and interest rates to capture external influences. It also predicts optimal stop-loss levels to enhance risk management during market volatility. This comprehensive approach aims to deliver more accurate, transparent, and data-driven trade entry and exit predictions, addressing existing model limitations and supporting better decision-making in complex markets.
